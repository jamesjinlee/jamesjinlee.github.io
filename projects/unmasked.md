Unmasked is an app designed to be a mental health resource for students on campus. With the power of anonymity students can talk openly about how they feel, through both struggle and joy. Unmasked fosters a community of support, in which students can like/empathize with another post, create threads on other people's posts, and directly message other users.

Unmasked is currently under development. The front end is being built with React Native, while the back end is being built with MongoDB + Express + Node.js.

I am currently working on both the Development and Design team.
