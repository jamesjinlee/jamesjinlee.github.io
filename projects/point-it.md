summary: An interactive web map application backed with a MySQL database and the Google Maps API.

Point It! is a database-backed web application using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/). Users can find where they are through the Google Maps API and add a point to mark off their favorite locations and categorize them as a restaurant, landmark, public area, etc.

In this project, I gained experience making database-backed web applications using PHP, MySQL, and the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) development environment (with a dash of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
It was also the first time I used the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)-- a well known and popular API.

The most important takeway from this project was learning about the different [HTTP Request](https://github.com/rmccue/Requests) types such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Learning how to use HTTP Requests plays a large role in [REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com/) which stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is used a lot in professional software development and knowing how to use basic HTTP Requests is definitely the first step into learning how to build a RESTful API.

This project was inspired by [MERCI](http://www.oceanit.com/products/merci), the mobile Geographical Information System (GIS) app I configured during my internship at [Oceanit](http://www.oceanit.com/) in the summer of 2015. 
The main difference is that this application is meant for everyday people to mark points of interests as opposed to emergency response units marking points to perform damage assessments.
