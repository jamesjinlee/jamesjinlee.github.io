PIPE (Programming in Pure English) is a console application turns English language sentences and translates them into C for Botball robots. This project won [Best of Computer Science](https://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/DOE%20Forms/HDO/Science%20Fair%202014.pdf) at the 2014 Honolulu District Science Fair and earned the [Computer Science Award](http://scifair-dev.weebly.com/uploads/2/1/4/7/21471206/list_of_winners_by_district.pdf) from the University of Hawaii at Manoa Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the 2014 Hawaii State Science and Engineering Fair.

After a command is entered, the program scans for keywords mapped to selected commands in the [Botball](http://www.botball.org/) C library (based on the 2013 Student Developers Kit) and translates them into C file that is ready for Botball robots to run.

This was my first-ever programming project using the first programming language I learned. Now that I am I college junior, I feel that it was probably a bad idea for a high school junior to pick C as his first programming language to learn. It was definitely a huge learning curve from teaching myself how to program to creating an application that accomplishes a goal. 

What drove me to create PIPE was my desire to simplify programming for beginning programmers. I also wanted a cool demo with a robot at my booth so I decided to do something with a robot. From this high school science fair project, I had my first experience with Natural Language Processing (a popular topic in Computer Science) and learned basic C concepts such as if-statements, for-loops, pointers and I/O. 

Today, I am a Computer Science major at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I also volunteer as a high school project judge and mentor high school students for [Hawaii Science Fairs](http://www.hawaiiacademyofscience.org/) as a way of "giving back" to the things that lead me to where I am today. I've definitely made a huge improvement as a programmer since high school.
